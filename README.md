# Collaborative etiquette

This project is an **Open Source** project encouraging everyone to be fearless in their contributions. This document lists some ground rules to foster a happy collaborative atmosphere.

* Individuals making valuable contributions are added as collaborators (commit access).

* This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded project.

<br>

## Contributing

* __Don't be afraid!__ You don't need to submit code to contribute to the success of a project! Don't hold back on submitting issues, commenting on discussions and helping people out.

* __Tell us everything.__ When filing bug reports, be generous in the details: environment, OS, browser, steps to replicate, and so on.

<br>

## Submitting code

* __Check development notes.__ Any details on setting up a development environment, running tests, releasing versions and such are kept in a file like `NOTES.md`.

* __Be a good citizen.__ Try your best to adhere to the established styles of the project. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't break them, but be prepared to have a reason if you do.

* __Be informative.__ Format your pull requests nicely. Include screenshots if applicable.

<br>

## For collaborators

Individuals making valuable contributions are encouraged to be added as collaborators (commit access). This status should be given *liberally.*

* __Work in branches then send a PR.__ Just because you have full commit access doesn't mean you shouldn't use pull requests. PRs are a great way to solicit feedback from co-collaborators and to give them a nice overview of what's going on.

* __Review outstanding PRs.__ Feel free to merge any you see fit, and leave comments on anything that needs revisions. If you don't feel comfortable merging them, at least comment with a `:+1:` to signal your co-collaborators that it's passed your review.

* __Push directly for micro-fixes.__ Only push to `master` for trivial updates that would be too noisy to notify your teammates of, such as typo fixes.

* __You can self-merge your PRs.__ Sometimes the rest of the team may be inactive, in which case, use your best judgement to self-merge PRs.

* __Keep history clean.__ No `--force` pushing on branches that aren't yours.

* __Communicate.__ You can use GitHub issues to communicate with your co-collaborators. Feel free to `@mention` them in issues.

* __Be nice.__ The collaborator team is nice, so we are all nice.

<br>

## For project releases

* __Release often.__ Publish patch versions as soon as fixes are ready.

* __Always tag releases.__ Tag them in the format of `v1.0.0`.

* __Maintain a changelog.__ Keep the `HISTORY.md` updated as new changes come in.

* __Consult the owner.__ By default, releases will be the prerogative of the project owner.

<br>

## For project owners

* __Set up continuous-integration.__ A CI service like [Travis] will inspect PR's so you don't have to.

* __Be decisive.__ Don't be afraid to put your foot down on issues like API design decisions.

* __Thank people.__ People put in their hard work. Gratitude goes a long way.

* __Be nice.__ The open source community is nice, so we are nice.
